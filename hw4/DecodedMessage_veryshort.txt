the beginning is simple to mark. we were in sunlight under a turkey oak, partly protected from a strong, gusty wind. i was kneeling on the grass with a corkscrew in my hand, and clarissa was passing me the bottle - a nineteen-eightyseven daumas gassac. this was the moment, this was the pinprick on the time map: i was stretching out my hand, and as the cool neck and the black foil touched my palm, we heard a mans shout. we turned to look across the field and saw the danger. next thing, i was running toward it. the transformation was absolute: i dont recall dropping the corkscrew, or getting to my feet, or making a decision, or hearing the caution clarissa called after me. what idiocy, to be racing into this story and its labyrinths, sprinting away from our happiness among the fresh spring grasses by the oak. there was the shout again, and a childs cry, enfeebled by the wind that roared in the tall trees along the hedgerows. i ran faster. and there, suddenly, from different points around the field, four other men were converging on the scene, running like me.  i see us from two hundred feet up, through the eyes of the buzzard we had watched earlier, soaring, circling, and dipping in the tumult of currents: five men running silently toward the center of a hundred-acre field. i approached from the southeast, with the wind at my back.
