# PM520 HW4
## In the current homework, we were asked to break the code, encoded using one-to-one substitution of En- glish letters. The substitution is the same for the entire message and a table of pairwise letter frequencies in the original text was given. We propose to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Metropolis- Hastings (MH) algorithm to break the code.
